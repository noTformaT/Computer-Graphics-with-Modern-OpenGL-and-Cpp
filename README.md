My OpenGL 3.x experiments
* Shaders - Shaders codes
* OpenGLApp - Minimal OpenGL app
* Uniform - Use Uniform variables in shaders
* Translation - Move verticles with glm::translate
* Rotation - Rotate verticles with glm::rotate
* Scaling - Scale verticles with glm::scale
* Interpolation - Interpolate values from vertex shader to fragment shader
* IndexDraws - Indexed draws triangles from points
* Projection - Perspective projection for render
* Transform - All transform operation (translate, rotation, scale) for meshes
* CameraRender - Render verticles with camera view matrix
* TextureMapping - UV mapping shaders for verticles
* AmbientLight- Draws triangles with ambient lighting
* DiffuseLighting - Draws triangles with diffuse lighting
* SpecularLighting - Draws triangles with specular lighting
* PointLight - Point and directional light source
* SpotLight - Spot, point and directional light source
* ModelImport - Simple model importer
* DirectionalShadowMap - Shadows with directional light
